👋 Hi, I’m Verônica! But you can also call me Ronnie!  
👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering and programming languages like Java, JavaScript, and HTML (for now).  
🌱 This year, I started my degree in Software Engineering, but to develop my skills more quickly, I also enrolled in a Full-stack Development course. Currently, I'm learning to build web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on study projects to help other beginner IT students learn something new or simply find inspiration to practice coding.  
😄 Pronouns: She/Her  
👀 Fun fact: I'm 30 years old and the mom of an incredible little boy! For years, I've been trying to find a profession that aligns with who I am, and this year (2024), I finally found something that truly excites me! I've fallen in love with the vast IT universe, and I couldn't be happier!
